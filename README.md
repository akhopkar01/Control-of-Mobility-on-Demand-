# Control-of-Mobility-on-Demand-
Using concepts of queueing theory to control the mobility on demand of network of autonomous vehicles.
The work is based on the research paper 'Control of robotic mobility-on-demand: A queueing theory perspective' by Rick Zhang and M. Pavone
A Jackson model is implemented to automate the process of an autonomous transportation service. The project uses the concept of a client-server architecture. Each station taken into consideraiton, serves the role of a server and the passengers (generated by a random gaussian process) serves as the clients. 
Documentation of the project is available as well. Please contact to request for an elaborate documentation, if required. The report now belongs to University of Maryland, college park
